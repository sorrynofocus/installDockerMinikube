# Install Docker CE and Minikube on Ubuntu 20.4

In this repo, I wanted to have scripts install Docker CE and Minikube on an Ubuntu 20.4.x VM to create projects. 

This repo will expand as I begin to add projects and documentation. For now, it's a good start. :)

Current install setup for Docker CE will be the latest and Minikube will be v1.31.0. You can adjust those in the install scripts if needed.


# Build

To begin using the scripts, simply clone this repo and copy them onto your Ubuntu 20.4 instance. I use VMWare workstation to start my instances and SSH into them using MobaXTerm or your favorite SSH application. 

Run sudo on the commands to install Docker CE and Minikube and you can begin working with them after a quick reboot.
